   - **Student Mode:** Students can access the system to take practice tests, assess their knowledge, and receive instant feedback on their performance.
   - **Teacher Mode:** Teachers have access to additional functionalities for test creation, question bank management, and monitoring student progress.

3. **Menu-Based Navigation:**
   - The system employs an intuitive menu-based interface that allows users to easily navigate through various features and functionalities.

4. **Test Taking (Student Mode):**
   - Students can select from a list of available tests based on subjects or topics.
   - They can attempt MCQ tests with randomized questions and answer choices.
   - Instant scoring and feedback are provided upon test completion.
   - Performance history and statistics are accessible for self-assessment.

5. **Question Bank Management (Teacher Mode):**
   - Teachers can create and manage question banks, categorized by subjects or topics.
   - Add, edit, or delete MCQ questions within the question bank.
   - Organize questions into quizzes or tests with customizable parameters (e.g., test duration, difficulty level).
   - Assign tests to specific classes or students.

This project aims to enhance the learning and assessment process by providing an automated and user-friendly platform for both students and teachers. It streamlines the creation and management of MCQ tests while offering valuable insights into student performance, ultimately improving the overall educational experience.
